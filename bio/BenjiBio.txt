My name is Benji. My major is Computer Science at Drexel. I would describe myself as a hardworking, collaborative, and fast self-learner. Over the last year, I have been working on some projects to enhance experience and knowledge in the data field using different framework and libraries. I am eager to take on new challeges, develop my skills and contribute to the succes of the company.
